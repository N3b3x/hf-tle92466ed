# Doxygen Awesome Extensions

The HardFOC TLE92466ED Driver documentation uses the doxygen-awesome-css theme
directly from the submodule for modern styling and interactive features.

## Theme Files

The theme files are located in the `doxygen-awesome-css/` submodule:

### CSS Files
- `doxygen-awesome.css` - Main stylesheet with modern styling and dark mode support
- `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css` - Sidebar-only theme for better navigation
- `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only-darkmode-toggle.css` - Additional CSS for sidebar-only dark mode toggle

### JavaScript Extensions
- `doxygen-awesome-darkmode-toggle.js` - Dark/light mode toggle with automatic system preference detection
- `doxygen-awesome-fragment-copy-button.js` - Copy code fragments to clipboard on hover
- `doxygen-awesome-paragraph-link.js` - Link to specific paragraphs/sections
- `doxygen-awesome-interactive-toc.js` - Interactive table of contents with progress highlighting
- `doxygen-awesome-tabs.js` - Tabbed content organization

## Features

- **ðŸŒ“ Automatic Dark Mode**: Detects system preference and switches automatically
- **ðŸ“‹ Copy Buttons**: Hover over code blocks to copy them
- **ðŸ”— Paragraph Links**: Click the Â¶ symbol to get direct links to sections
- **ðŸ“‘ Interactive TOC**: Dynamic table of contents that highlights current section
- **ðŸ“‘ Tabs**: Organize content in tabbed interfaces
- **ðŸ“± Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Source

These files come directly from the
[doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css)
submodule located at `doxygen-awesome-css/`.

## Configuration

The extensions are configured in the root `Doxyfile`:

- `HTML_EXTRA_FILES` includes all JavaScript files from the submodule
- `HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET` includes the main CSS files from the submodule
- `HTML_COPY_CLIPBOARD = NO` (required for fragment copy button)

## Directory Structure

```text
_config/doxygen-extensions/
â”œâ”€â”€ doxygen-awesome-css/           # Submodule with theme files only
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ doxygen-awesome.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ doxygen-awesome-*.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .git                       # Git submodule reference
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                      # Configuration documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md                       # Main documentation page
â””â”€â”€ extensions.md                  # This file
```

This streamlined organization uses the submodule directly without unnecessary file duplication.
