#include "Arduino_HAL.hpp"

// Implementation is primarily in the header file for Arduino compatibility
// This file is included for future extensions and to maintain consistency
// with other platform implementations.

// Arduino HAL uses inline implementations in the header for simplicity
// and to avoid compilation issues with the Arduino IDE build system.
